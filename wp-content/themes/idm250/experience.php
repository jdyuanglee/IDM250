        Hi! This is Yuang Li, an international student from China majoring in Interactive Digital Media at Drexel University.
        <br>
        <br> I was born in Suzhou in 1998 then my family moved to Shenzhen when I was 6. Shenzhen locates on the southeastern
        of China and links to Hongkong. I lived there for 12 years and took all my education there. Studying abroad
        is a very important decision for me and my family. We made the decision when I was senior in middle school.
        <br>
        <br> I took 3-year's high school in the international department sponsored by a public high school. I have been
        through both Chinese high school's education (courses like Math, Physics, Chinese Literacy, etc.) and United
        States' high school's education. (courses like Natural Science, Social Science, Humanity, etc.) I also have
        tried and accomplished some my personal interests and activities in my life. I enjoy doing the pencil sketching,
        playing saxophone and attend many different kinds of activities related. I joined our high school's TV station
        and did video editing via Vegas Pro there. I always enjoy sports and try to be better. I found our high school
        American Football club and joined a team in the city playing against other football lovers. I practiced and
        learned some of my skills like photoshopping, choosing BGM, via those advertising activities.
