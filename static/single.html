                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>Over the past 10 weeks our group has been working closely with Schmear It and their customers to create a
                    brand new mobile ordering experience. We conducted primary research, went through multiple rounds of
                    ideation and user testing, and ultimately created a final interactive mockup in Sketch and Flinto. Through
                    this process we learned the importance of collaboration, user testing, team meetings, and understanding
                    business requirements. We are extremely pleased with the final application and hope Schmear It’s users
                    love it as well. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h1>Context and Challenge</h1>
                <p>Schmear It is a local Philadelphia bagel food truck established in 2013 and recently expanded into a physical
                    location in October 2016. Our team was tasked with developing a mobile application for Schmear It that
                    provided mobile ordering, rewards, and business information for their customers. This application would
                    substitute their existing order ahead solution on their website. We worked closely with Schmear It and
                    their customers to test and develop this mobile application over the past 10 weeks.</p>
                <p>While Schmear It already had a mobile ordering function built into their website. It wasn’t advertised or
                    communicated to users very clearly on their website (especially the mobile site) or at their physical
                    locations. The goal of this application was to bring mobile ordering to Schmear It in an accessible and
                    discoverable way for users, while preserving the unique personality and branding Schmear It has developed.
                    The application should also promote their build-your-own option as this is their preferred way for people
                    to order and their collaboration with charities.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h1>Process and Insight</h1>
                <p>We began the design process by establishing a relationship with Schmear It. We created a business model canvas
                    and project model canvas for the company. After that we began visiting the truck and store to observe
                    the ordering process and the customer experience Schmear It provides.</p>
                <img src="resources/Starbucks.png" alt="2">
                <p>From there we began conducting competitive research on competing mobile ordering applications to determine
                    what ideas, flows, and features were already on the market. We determined our target audience based on
                    the surrounding area and the customers we saw from visiting Schmear It. We determined our primary customer
                    types were students, commuters, medical professionals, and to a lesser degree tourists.</p>
                <img src="resources/Sketches.png" alt="3">
                <p>After our initial research and planning, we began to sketch wireframes for potential designs and user flows.
                    This process, like every process was collaborative and we went through 2 rounds of wireframes before
                    moving to digital mockups.</p>
                <img src="resources/Mood-Board.png" alt="4">
                <p>From there we made individual mood boards that we combined into a unified team mood board with our color
                    palette, potential iconography, fonts, etc.</p>
                <img src="resources/WF.png" alt="5">
                <p>We then began creating wireframes in Sketch and tested paper prototypes with users.</p>
                <img src="resources/Interview.png" alt="6">
                <p>After testing with paper prototypes we moved into testing digital mockups with scripted user interviews.
                    We repeated this testing every week from weeks 6-10. After each round of testing we regrouped as a team,
                    discussed our user feedback, and determined what changes needed to be made for the following week. Collectively
                    we tested with approximately 50 users over weeks 6-10. In week 7, we began using Flinto to add animation
                    and navigation to our prototypes. The navigation went through several revisions as the first few prototypes
                    were difficult to navigate. By week 10 we had a final prototype that went through one final round of
                    testing and validation.</p>
                <p>
                    Overall we split the initial wireframe sketches and user testing between each team member. Alex Aslid created mockups in
                    sketch and the final presentation. Alex Huffaker helped create standardized UI elements in Sketch and
                    the final case study.
                </p>
                <p>Yuang Li created the initial wireframes in Sketch for testing and assisted Jordan with animations in Flinto.
                    Jordan Zagerman focused on talking with the business, users, and later animations in Flinto. Miles was
                    responsible for creating graphics and did the final work in Sketch before it was passed off to the Flinto
                    team.

                <h1>Solution</h1>
                <p>
                    From the start we wanted ordering to be as easy and fast as possible. This was a defining trait that drove our design decisions.
                    This led to the removal of an initial sign up screen and was a driving factor for the adoption of an
                    ever-present card style cart.
                </p>
                <img src="resources/Splash.png" alt="7">
                <p>
                    You can see the application clearly promotes the charity Schmear It is working with that month as well as displaying their
                    logo and branding.
                </p>
                <img src="resources/Schmear-It-Hero.png" alt="8">
                <p>
                    The home screen allows the users to dive immediately into the menu and ordering process. A card-style cart is persistent
                    at the bottom of the ordering section of the application. The location and account pages are positioned
                    to the left and right respectively and can be navigated with a swipe left or right or by tapping the
                    respective icon from the navigation bar.
                </p>
                <img src="resources/Hours-Location.png" alt="9">
                <p>The location and times of the truck are clearly displayed under the about section so users are aware it closes
                    early and the location changes.</p>
                <img src="resources/Account.png" alt="10">
                <p>Rewards status, past orders, and account settings are all under one screen thanks to user feedback and provide
                    a general account overview.</p>
                <img src="resources/BYO.png" alt="11">
                <p>Custom orders guide users through a step by step flow where they can select their bagel type, toasted option,
                    base spread, and mix-ins. Each of the bagel icons were recreated in Schmear It’s graphic style.

                </p>
                <img src="resources/Cart.png" alt="12">
                <p>The checkout process allows for setting a custom pickup time and location when ordering ahead.</p>
                <img src="resources/Payments.png" alt="13">
                <p>
                    The payment info screen displays the user’s rewards status and alerts them if a reward is available before they complete
                    the checkout. We also accept multiple forms of payment including Apple Pay for faster checkouts.
                </p>
                <img src="resources/Order-Conf.png" alt="14">
                <p>
                    The order confirmation screen clearly shows the location and estimated pickup time. It also has a barcode for the store to
                    scan upon pickup.
                </p>
                <img src="resources/Order-Processing-1.png" alt="15">
                <p>Once an order is placed, a new order status button appears on the home screen.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h1>Results</h1>
                <p>Overall we feel this project has been very successful due to the branding, ease of use, and feedback from
                    users. We met all of the business’ criteria to promote custom orders. User feedback was tracked through
                    quantitative user studies with users reporting increasing satisfaction week to week. The application
                    itself is very straight forward with its ordering process and the lack of an initial sign up screen greatly
                    decreases first time setup for new users.</p>
                <p>
                    Creating a consistent meeting time really helped us stay on track even if one or two members weren’t able to make it that
                    week. These meetings became less consistent as the project began wrapping up due to external conflicts
                    from group members and affected the final product. In the future we would be stricter about these team
                    meetings and at least one occurred a week outside of class. Sharing Sketch and Flinto files between the
                    team also proved an obstacle as the team multiple versions for testing and the roles changed weekly.
